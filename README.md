# Mobile App User Behavior Analysis

This Jupyter notebook contains an analysis of user behavior in a mobile app. The dataset used in this assessment is a sample of user behavior logs, stored in CSV format. The key columns in the dataset are:
• Customer ID: A unique identifier assigned to each customer, ensuring distinction across the
dataset.
• Gender: Specifies the gender of the customer, allowing for gender-based analytics.
• Age: Represents the age of the customer, enabling age-group-specific insights.
• City: Indicates the city of residence for each customer, providing geographic insights.
• Membership Type: Identifies the type of membership held by the customer, influencing perks
and benefits.
• Total Spend: Records the total monetary expenditure by the customer on the e-commerce
platform.
• Items Purchased: Quantifies the total number of items purchased by the customer.
• Average Rating: Represents the average rating given by the customer for purchased items,
gauging satisfaction.
• Discount Applied: Indicates whether a discount was applied to the customer's purchase,
influencing buying behavior.
• Days Since Last Purchase: Reflects the number of days elapsed since the customer's most
recent purchase, aiding in retention analysis.
• Satisfaction Level: Captures the overall satisfaction level of the customer, providing a subjective
measure of their experience.

## Objective

The objective of this notebook is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of users in the mobile app using data exploration (EDA), machine learning, and visualization techniques.

## Contents

The notebook is divided into several main sections:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This section explores the characteristics and structure of the dataset, identifies missing values, trends, and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to make it suitable for analysis and modeling, which may include data cleaning, variable transformation, etc.
3. **Machine Learning**: Different machine learning models are applied to the data to predict or classify certain target variables based on available features.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizations are created to illustrate the trends, relationships, and patterns discovered in the data.

## Execution Instructions

To run this notebook, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.preprocessing
- sklearn.linear_model
- sklearn.metrics

Make sure you have installed these libraries via pip or conda before running the notebook. You can execute each cell of the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analyses and visualizations.
